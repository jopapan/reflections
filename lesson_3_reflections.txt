When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share code with others and to backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone may change code and overwrite mine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is used to clone code (whatever) from another user in github.
Branch is used to experiment in my local directory without affecting master.
Clone is used to setup a clone of my own / another users repository locally.
